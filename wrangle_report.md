## Reporting: wrangle_report


#### Gathering:
I first downloaded the twitter-archive csv file then read into a pandas dataframe. Then with requests I gathered images as well as texts, machine learning predictions of each dog image tweeted. I transferred these requests to another dataframe. Lastly using twitter API I gathered tweet ids, retweet counts and favorite counts of people that used twitter to tweet on We_Rate_Dogs. I wrote this data to a json file which I transfered into a third dataframe.

#### Assessing:
After gathering all the data into three dataframes, I investigated the data in each dataframe. There were some duplicates and null values because of retweets. The data types in some columns were incorrect, and not matching between the three data frames. The dog name column had erroneous words like 'a, all, by' for dogs that needed to be corrected. There were four columns dedicated to dog stages. Most of the rating denominators had the value 10 or closer to it. However, there were also some odd numbers like 50, 80which I was going to change to 10. After closer examination I realized people multiplied the numerator and denominator with the amount of dogs they had, which resulted in an acceptable rating ratio. In the numerator column there were some odd numbers like '1776', but upon closer examination it was apparent the numbers were entered intentionally and did not need changing. Also, there was no rating ratio column to indicate a rating for the dogs. In the images data the probability columns had mixed case lettering for dog breeds. Also, some of these observations were not a dog breed at all but other animals, or objects. However, since this was the outcome of the machine guessing, it did not need to be corrected.

#### Cleaning:
First got rid of the retweeted data that created duplicates in some columns. Then I removed the columns that had a lot of missing information. After that I corrected some of the data types in columns such as tweet_id, timestamp, rating_numerator, and rating_denominator. In the names column I unified all the incorrect words with the word 'None' to indicate none was entered as a name. I joined all three data frames for ease of data processing and accuracy. I created a 'dog stages' column merging all four separate dog stages columns into one. I also added a 'rating' column calculating the rating ratio for each tweet. After that I adjusted the letter casing to lower case in the probability columns for dog breeds to unify the lettering for ease of data processing.
